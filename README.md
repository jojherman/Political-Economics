# Political Economics Repository

Dear reader,

Please find the PDF documents attached.

In this repository, we have four files: .Rnw, .Tex, .Rmd and .PDF all created using R statistical language. You can view the output on the PDF files, while you can run the .Rnw on R studio to view the code and generate the PDF document which automatically creates the .Tex file. You can use .Rmd to view the document online as a html document: https://rpubs.com/jojherman
